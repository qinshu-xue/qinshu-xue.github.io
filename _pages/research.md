## Working Papers

**[Default Risk Heterogeneity and Borrower Selection in the Mortgage Market](http://qinshu-xue.github.io/files/Qinshu_JMP_web)** 
 
>This paper exploits variation from an institutional change in mortgage underwriting standards to document that the debt payment-to-income ratio is not a sufficient measure of default risk.  As a result, households exhibit substantial heterogeneity in their ability to repay conditional on their debt payment-to-income ratios.  To explain this, the paper studies an otherwise standard incomplete-markets life-cycle model with a competitive mortgage market in which lenders have discretion to exempt households whose equilibrium default probability satisfies a creditworthiness threshold from a debt payment-to-income limit.  The model uniquely matches and rationalizes empirical patterns of default risk heterogeneity in the mortgage market.  The model highlights welfare gains resulting from policy reforms that increase lender flexibility.

**[Sovereign Debt Composition in Advanced Economies: A Historical Perspective](http://malin-hu.github.io/files/SDCAE.pdf)** [[IMF WP No. 14/162](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Sovereign-Debt-Composition-in-Advanced-Economies-A-Historical-Perspective-41899), [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2504950), [VoxEU](https://voxeu.org/article/advanced-economies-sovereign-debt-100-years-data)]

Updated: September 2014  
>We examine how the composition of public debt, broken down by currency, maturity, holder profile and marketability, has responded to major debt accumulation and consolidation episodes during 1900-2011. Covering thirteen advanced economies, we focus on debt structure shifts that occurred around the two World Wars and global economic downturns, and the subsequent debt consolidations. Notwithstanding data gaps, we are able to recover some broad common patterns. Episodes of large debt accumulation---essentially, large increases in debt supply---were typically absorbed by increases in short-term, foreign currency-denominated, and banking-system-held debt. However, this pattern did not hold during the debt build-ups starting in the 1980s and 1990s, which were compositionally skewed toward long-term local-currency debt. We attribute this change to higher structural demand for sovereign paper, linked to capital account liberalization in advanced economies, the emergence of a large contractual saving sector, and innovative sovereign debt products. With regard to debt consolidations, we find support for the financial repression-cum-inflation channel for post World War II debt reductions. However, the scope for a repeat of this strategy appears limited unless financial liberalization and globalization were materially rolled back or the current globally agreed monetary policy regime built around price stability abandoned. Neither are significant favorable structural demand shifts, as witnessed in the 1980s and 1990s, likely.

## Works in Progress

**The Consumption Insurance Role of Homeownership**  
<!-- >I establish a set of stylized facts regarding the consumption insurance role of homeownership.  Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I first show that the decline in nondurable consumption among owners during periods of low earnings is less than one-third the size of the consumption decrease of renters under equivalent circumstances.  Next, I demonstrate that increased borrowing collateralized by the primary residence, or equity extraction, can account for the aforementioned consumption response of owners.  Conditioning on an owner's initial stock of liquid savings is crucial: the consumption responses of equity extractors and non-extractors among the subset of owners with relatively high levels of liquid assets do not exhibit any significant difference.  These findings suggest that the self-insurance role of homeownership is more salient for liquidity constrained owners. -->
