## Working Papers

**[Vertical Relations, Demand Risk, and Upstream Concentration: the Case of the US Automobile Industry](http://qinshu-xue.github.io/files/Qinshu_JMP_web)** 
 
>This paper studies how upstream market concentration and demand risk affect downstream firms' outsourcing decisions. I formulate a structural model in which outsourcing allows the downstream firms to avoid the uncertain in-house production cost by switching to a stable price and where upstream firms leverage the insurance motive of downstream firms by increasing prices. The model delivers equilibrium outsourcing patterns, as well as equilibrium upstream prices. I estimate the model using data on the vehicle manufacturers and upstream transmission firms in the automobile industry. Facing a negative demand shock equivalent to the recent pandemic, when the upstream firms' prices are fixed, outsourcing from upstream firms mitigates the rise in transmissions' production cost by 48%. Endogenizing upstream's price response to downstream firms' outsourcing incentives increases their prices by $137.18 (7%). Next, I evaluate the potential impact of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. When the upstream market is more concentrated under the protectionist trade policy, the upstream's price response to the same pandemic demand shock is 68% larger. It further amplifies the impact of economic downturns on consumer welfare and manufacturers' profit by 65%.

Updated: September 2014  
>We examine how the composition of public debt, broken down by currency, maturity, holder profile and marketability, has responded to major debt accumulation and consolidation episodes during 1900-2011. Covering thirteen advanced economies, we focus on debt structure shifts that occurred around the two World Wars and global economic downturns, and the subsequent debt consolidations. Notwithstanding data gaps, we are able to recover some broad common patterns. Episodes of large debt accumulation---essentially, large increases in debt supply---were typically absorbed by increases in short-term, foreign currency-denominated, and banking-system-held debt. However, this pattern did not hold during the debt build-ups starting in the 1980s and 1990s, which were compositionally skewed toward long-term local-currency debt. We attribute this change to higher structural demand for sovereign paper, linked to capital account liberalization in advanced economies, the emergence of a large contractual saving sector, and innovative sovereign debt products. With regard to debt consolidations, we find support for the financial repression-cum-inflation channel for post World War II debt reductions. However, the scope for a repeat of this strategy appears limited unless financial liberalization and globalization were materially rolled back or the current globally agreed monetary policy regime built around price stability abandoned. Neither are significant favorable structural demand shifts, as witnessed in the 1980s and 1990s, likely.

## Works in Progress

**The Consumption Insurance Role of Homeownership**  
<!-- >I establish a set of stylized facts regarding the consumption insurance role of homeownership.  Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I first show that the decline in nondurable consumption among owners during periods of low earnings is less than one-third the size of the consumption decrease of renters under equivalent circumstances.  Next, I demonstrate that increased borrowing collateralized by the primary residence, or equity extraction, can account for the aforementioned consumption response of owners.  Conditioning on an owner's initial stock of liquid savings is crucial: the consumption responses of equity extractors and non-extractors among the subset of owners with relatively high levels of liquid assets do not exhibit any significant difference.  These findings suggest that the self-insurance role of homeownership is more salient for liquidity constrained owners. -->
