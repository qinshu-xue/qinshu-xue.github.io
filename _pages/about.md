Hi! I am an assistant professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University [Antai College of Economics and Management](https://acem.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research interests are Empirical Industrial Organization, Firm Dynamics and Trade. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [Cornell University](http://economics.cornell.edu) under the supervision of [Julieta Caunedo](http://www.julietacaunedo.com/) (co-chair), [Panle Jia Barwick](https://barwick.economics.cornell.edu/) (co-chair), [Giulia Brancaccio](http://www.giulia-brancaccio.com/), and [JÃ¶rg Stoye](https://stoye.economics.cornell.edu/).
